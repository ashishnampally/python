In fact, it instructs one to kill under\\n#certain circumstances.     \\n\\nI'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly\\nharmless.\\n#\\n#|> For my part, I conclude that something\\n#|> else is required.  I also happen to believe that that something\\n#|> else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will\\n#|> do.\\n#\\n#And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?\\n\\nNot necessarily.  \\\"Love thy neighbour\\\" does not supply a them/us - it\\ndemolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|> #being religiously motivated.\\n#|> \\n#|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|> he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated.\\n#\\n#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic \\n#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?\\n\\nNot in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \\\"religion did this\\\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's\\nnot nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart\\nfrom violence of course.\\n#\\n#|> #It's not an abstract \\\"argument\\\".

I'm pretty much\\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\\nfrom someone else.\\n\\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\\nThis is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a\\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\"\\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\\nport board.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\nTom\\n\\n-- \\n|Tom Barrett (TDBear), Sr. Engineer|tom.barrett@amd.com|v:512-462-6856 |\\n|AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.
